## Welcome to my site for Moneydance Extensions and Scripts written in Python

_NOTE: I AM JUST A USER - I HAVE NO AFFILIATION WITH MONEYDANCE! (but I do use all my scripts on my own live dataset...)

**DISCLAIMER**: ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR DATA BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES - The author cannot accept any responsibility from the use of these scripts

Moneydance allows you to run Python scripts and access its functions via their API.
This allows you to perform all sorts of 'wonderful' things based on your own financial data.

Python is actual Jython 2.7 and accesses the Moneydance Java codebase.

My scripts and extensions are identical. The extension version(s0 are simply a 'packaged' script version.

Click a link below to download a ZIP file. The ZIP file contains both the Extension (if available) and Script version for you to choose from....
- Extensions have a file extension of *.mxt
- Scripts have a file extension of *.py

**To run Extensions:**
1) Install the Extension. Load Moneydance, Menu>Extensions>add from file>choose <extension_name>.mxt file
2) Accept the warning that the extension is unsigned / missing (this simply means that Moneydance have not signed / verified my extension). Click Install Extension.
3) Once its installed, restart Moneydance.
4) From now on, just click Menu>Extensions and the name of the Extension

**To run Scripts:**
1) Load Moneydance. Menu>Window>Show Moneybot Console
2) Open Script>choose <scriptname>.py file
3) Click RUN (and not run snippet)
4) That's it.... Repeat these steps each time.
